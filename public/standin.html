                    Ergatas will be a free search engine for finding missionaries! Have you ever felt like you wanted to be
                    part of the Great Commission, but were not able to go on a trip yourself, and didn't know 
                    any missionaries personally? It can be daunting trying to decide who to donate to. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Ergatas aims to help those in that situation. Missionaries who are raising funds can 
                    create a profile on the site at no cost, describing their ministry, where they will be ministering, what 
                    job skills they will be applying, and lots more. 
                    </p>


                    <p>
                    Those seeking to find a missionary to support can then come to the site and search for a missionary
                    based on whatever criteria they are interested in. Perhaps they work in IT and would 
                    love to support a missionary also working in IT. Or they have a heart for Mozambique and
                    want to support someone ministering there, without having to first find out what organizations 
                    are operating there. With Ergatas, you can find missionaries from all different organizations, 
                    all over the world!
                    </p>


                    <p>
                    When you want to make a donation, clicking the donate link will simply take you to the 
                    organizations donation page for that missionary. Ergatas does not take a dime from the donation! You can also
                    be confident that your donation is going to the right place because you make the donation
                    on the organization's site. The fact that the organization has provided them with 
                    a donation link also gives you confidence that the organization has vetted the missionary.

                    <b>What does "Ergatas" mean?</b>
                    <p>"Ergatas" is a greek word that means "worker". It comes from Mathew 9:37-38 (NIV): 
                        " Then he said to his disciples, 'The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. 
                        Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers (ergatas) into his harvest field.' "
                        Ergatas aims to help send more workers!
                    </p>
                    <b>How do you pronouce "Ergatas"?</b>
                    <p>
                        <audio id="ergatas-sample" controls src="ergatas-sample.mp3" ></audio>
                    </p>
                    <b>What will Ergatas cost? </b>
                    <p>Ergatas will be completely free to both users and missionaries! Anyone can come to the site and perform
                        a search. Clicking the donate button for a particular missionary will simply take them to that missionaries
                        existing donation page on their organizations site, and the user can donate directly to the missionary. We do not take any amount
                        of the donation. We're just here to help make the connection.
                    </p>
                    <b>Aren't there other non-profit search pages out there?</b>
                    <p>Yes, there are a few sites out there that allow you to search through all registered non-profits.
                        Ergatas is different for a few reasons. The main difference is that we focus on individual
                        missionaries. Ergatas aims to help missionaries raise support, not help
                        organizations fund their ministries. Of course, the organization benifits by having a 
                        fully funded missionary! A second difference is that we are focused only on Christian organizations.
                    </p>

                    <b>How can I trust that the search results represent real missionaries?</b>
                    <p>
                    It is critical that users be able to have faith in the validity of the missionaries represented! This will
                    be accomplished in a few ways. First, the missionary must select their organization from an approved
                    list. These will have been manually inspected to ensure that they are registered
                    501c(3) organizations, that the given website truly belongs to the organization, and that they
                    are compatible with the statement of faith. 
                    If the missionaries organization is not listed, they may apply to have the organization considered for 
                    inclusion. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Secondly, the donation link given in the profile must match the verified domain of the organizations website.
                    Finally, profiles will be able to be flagged by users for review. 
                    </p>

                    <b>How can I know that each missionary is spreading the right gospel?</b>
                    <p>Each missionary will be asked to agree to a statement of faith before being allowed to create
                        a profile. Further, uses can visit their organizations site and read their statement of
                        faith as well.
                    </p>
                    <b>Don't most people only support missionaries they know? </b>
                    <p>It is very often the case that a missionaries partners come from people they have a prior
                        relationship with, and that is a wonderful thing! We firmly believe that missionaries 
                        should continue to cultivate relationships with people during partnership development.
                    </p>
                    <p>But there are also some people who are interested in supporting missionaries who fit certain 
                        criteria, even if they don't know the missionary personally. For example, a doctor might 
                        want to support a medically skilled missionary. Or an IT worker might want to support a 
                        missionary with some tech skills. Someone who has a heart for a particular country might
                        want to support a missionary working in that country, etc. 
                    </p>
                    <p>These are the kinds of people that Ergatas will be most helpful to. Of course, once a user 
                        finds a missionary to support, we would heartily encourage them to get to know their missionary, 
                        build a relationship, and pray for them.
                    </p>
                    

                    <b>How will Ergatas be funded? </b>
                    <p>Ergatas will be funded through some combination of non-intrusive Christian ads, and/or donations 
                        directly to Ergatas. 
                    </p>

                    <b>Why build Ergatas?</b>
                    <p>We've been working as "raise your own support" missionaries for many years, some of us for over 15 years. 
                        We know that raising support can be a challenge! And Ergatas will by no means turn that into
                        a piece of cake. But, we hope to make it a little easier by opening a door to allow partners to 
                        find missionaries, as well as missionaries to find partners.
