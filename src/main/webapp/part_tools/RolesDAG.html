				Select a role name to see all super-roles or all sub-roles. Chang the direction to either "Explode upward"
				to see the super-roles (things the select role inherits), or select "Explode downward" to
				see the sub-roles (everything that inherts the selected role, directly or indirectly). If you change the 
				direction, hit the "Go" button to update the graph. Changes in the role selector update the graph right away.
				<p>
				The selected node will always appear at the top of the screen, regardless of which direction is chosen. You just have change
				your understanding of what the edge direction means. 
				<p>
				Graphs can take up to a minute or so to generate.
