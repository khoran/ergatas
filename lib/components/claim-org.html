        Every organization (church or agency) has a default landing page which displays all workers
        at that organization, but it can also be customized. A landing page provides a short link and QR 
        code to make it easy to share.  It can also be embedded in your own website. This is useful 
        for several situations.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're a church supporting Kingdom Workers from different agencies, we can provide a common 
        landing page to display them all on. Create one place to send your congregation members where
        then can learn about all your partner workers.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can either have your partner workers create their own Ergatas profiles, and then add 
        them, or you can request permission to create and edit profiles on their behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
        Or, if you represent an agency or sending church and you want to be able create and edit profiles
        for your own workers, you can request permission to do that through this form. We'll
        also create a landing page, as described above.
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps you represent a mobilization agency and you'd like to collect all the workers connected
        with your partner agencies, or workers you've helped place at other agencies. Creating a 
        landing page is a great way to present them all together to potential partners!
