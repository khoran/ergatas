    <h1>
      We affirm the World Evangelical Alliance (WEA) Statement of Faith.
    </h1>

    <h2>
        We Believe in:
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Holy Scriptures as originally given by God, divinely inspired, infallible, entirely trustworthy; and the supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct.</li>
        <li>One God, eternally existent in three persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit</li>
        <li>Our Lord Jesus Christ, God manifest in the flesh, His virgin birth, His sinless human life, His divine miracles, His vicarious and atoning death, His bodily resurrection, His ascension, His mediatorial work, and his personal return in power and glory.</li>
        <li>The Salvation of lost and sinful man through the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ by faith apart from works, and regeneration by the Holy Spirit.</li>
        <li>The Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the believer is enabled to live a holy life, to witness and work for the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
        <li>The Unity of the Spirit of all true believers, the Church, the Body of Christ.</li>
        <li>The Resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved unto the resurrection of life, they that are lost unto the resurrection of damnation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        In addition, we also believe:

    </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>God creates each person with an immutable biological sex - male or female - that reflects the image and likeness of God.</li>
        <li>God designed marriage as a unique conjugal relationship joining one man and one woman in a single, exclusive, life-long union, and God intends sexual intimacy only to occur within that relationship.</li>
        <li>God endows all human life with inherent dignity, and it must be respected and protected from conception to natural death.</li>
    </ul>
