                some paperwork out of the way, to make sure we're all on the same page!
                </p>

                <p>Please review the links and documents below and if everything seems good, then click "I agree"

                <h3>Keep Up To Date</h3>
                <p>To get the most out of your profile, you need to keep it up-to-date! Anytime your 
                    support level changes, be sure to mark that in your profile.
                    We'll send you some reminders, but if 4 months pass with no updates we will 
                    stop showing your profile and notify you by email. You can re-activate it at anytime using the 
                    link in the email, we won't delete anything. 
                </p>
                <p>If it just so happens that nothing has changed over that time period , that's fine, just load your profile
                    and then click save. That way we know you haven't forgotten about us!
