            some paperwork out of the way, to make sure we're all on the same page!
            </p>

            <p>Please review the links and documents below and if everything seems good, then click "I agree"

            <h3>Keep Up To Date</h3>
            <p>To get the most out of your profile, you need to keep it up-to-date! Anytime your 
                support level changes, be sure to mark that in your profile. If a month goes by with
                no updates, we'll send you a reminder email. But if no updates are made for 2 months, we will 
                stop showing your profile, and notify you by email. You can re-activate it at anytime using the 
                link in the email. 
            </p>
            <p>If it just so happens that nothing has changed over the month, that's fine, just load your profile
                and then click save. That way we know you haven't forgotten about us!
