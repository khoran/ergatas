                        We offer the unique ability to search for missionaries across organizations
                        with specific criteria.

                        Do you have a passion in your heart to help a specific people group? Or a particular 
                        country? Wouldn't it be great if you could find missionaries already making an
                        impact in those areas and come alongside them and their ministry?

                    <p>
                        In all theses scenarios, Ergatas makes it possible to find missionaries who are already 
                        on their way to the mission field to accomplish the work that you care about.
