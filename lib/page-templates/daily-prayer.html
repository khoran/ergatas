                   Would you like to pray for a worker on Ergatas each day? We
                   can send you reminders each day. Just sign up using one of
                   the methods below.
                   </p>

                   <h4>Notifications</h4>
                   <p>
                   This is a good method if you have installed Ergatas on your
                   phone as an
                   app, or you plan to leave it open in a tab on your desktop.
                   You will get a notice once a day with a link to that day's
                   worker. You can read about their ministry and pray for
                   them.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                     This method will not work on Mac devices unfortunately
                   </p>
