                   <p>
                   Would you like to <a href="/learn/pray-for-a-missionary"
                      data-bind="click: navigateFn('learn/pray-for-a-missionary')">
                      pray for a worker</a> on Ergatas each week? We
                   can send you weekly reminders. 
                   </p>

                   <h4>Notifications</h4>
                   <p>
                   This is a good method if you have 
                   <a href="/about#install-app" data-bind="click: navigateFn('/about#install-app')">
                      installed Ergatas</a> on your
                   phone as an app, or you plan to leave it open in a browser tab.
                   You will get a notice once a week with a link to that weeks's
                   worker. You can read about their ministry and pray for
                   them.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                     This method will not work on Mac devices unfortunately.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                     When you click the button below, you'll be asked to grant
                   permission to receive notifications. We'll then send you
                   one right away to make sure it's working. If you don't see
                   it, <a href="/contact" data-bind="click: navigateFn('/contact')">let us know</a>.
                   This needs to be done on each device you want a
                   notification sent to.
                
                   </p>

                   <h4>Email</h4>
                   If email works best for you, fill in the form in the footer below and
                   we'll send you a weekly email with a link to that week's
                   worker. You can unsubscribe anytime.

                   <h4>Others Methods?</h4>
                   <p>
                     Is there another way you'd like to be reminded? 
                     Text message, or something else? 
                     <a href="/contact" data-bind="click: navigateFn('/contact')">Let us know</a>!
