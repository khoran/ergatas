                   Would you like to pray for a worker on Ergatas each day? We
                   can send you daily reminders. 
                   </p>

                   <h4>Notifications</h4>
                   <p>
                   This is a good method if you have 
                   <a href="/about#install-app" data-bind="click: navigateFn('/about#install-app')">
                      installed Ergatas</a> on your
                   phone as an app, or you plan to leave it open in a browser tab.
                   You will get a notice once a day with a link to that day's
                   worker. You can read about their ministry and pray for
                   them.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                     This method will not work on Mac devices unfortunately.
                   </p>

                     When you click the button below, you'll be asked to grant
                   permission to receive notifications. We'll then send you
                   one right away to make sure it's working. If you don't see
                   it, <a href="/contact" data-bind="click: navigateFn('/contact')">let us know</a>.
                
                   </p>
                   <button class="btn btn-ergatas-primary" data-bind="click: setupNotifications">Sign Up</button>

                   <h4>Others Methods?</h4>
                   <p>
                     Is there another way you'd like to be reminded? Email,
                   text message, or something else? 
                     <a href="/contact" data-bind="click: navigateFn('/contact')">Let us know</a>!
                   </p>
