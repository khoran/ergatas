            <p>Missionaries who are raising funds can

            While Ergatas will not remove the need for one-on-one partnership development, it aims to make the process a two
            way street. In addition to missionaries seeking partners, Ergatas allows partners to seek and find missionaries.

                            Ergatas is different for a few reasons. The main difference is that we focus on individual missionaries. 
                            Ergatas aims to help missionaries raise support, not help organizations fund their projects (funding projects
                            is of course a worthy goal, just not our goal!). 
                            Of course, the organization benefits by having a fully funded missionary. A second difference is that 
                            we are focused only on Christian organizations.</p>

                                <p>It is critical that users be able to have faith in the validity of the missionaries represented.
                                    This is accomplished in a few ways. First, the missionary must select their organization from 
                                    an approved list. These have been manually inspected to ensure that they are registered 501c(3) 
                                    organizations, that the given website truly belongs to the organization, and that they are compatible 
                                    with the statement of faith.</p>
                                <p>If the missionaries organization is not listed, they may apply to have the organization considered for 
                                    inclusion.
                                </p>
                                <p>Secondly, the donation link given in the profile must match the verified domain of the organizations 
                                    website. The fact that the organization has provided them with a donation link also gives you 
                                    confidence that the organization has vetted the missionary.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Finally, profiles can be flagged by users for review if anything looks suspicious.

                                <p>It is very often the case that a missionaries partners come from people they have a prior relationship with, and that is a wonderful thing! We firmly believe that missionaries should continue to cultivate relationships with people during partnership development.
                                </p>
                                <p>But there are also some people who are interested in supporting missionaries who fit certain criteria, even if they don't know the missionary personally. For example, a doctor might want to support a medically skilled missionary. Or an IT worker might want to support a missionary with some tech skills. Someone who has a heart for a particular country might want to support a missionary working in that country, etc.
                                </p>
                                <p>These are the kinds of people that Ergatas will be most helpful to. Of course, once a user finds a missionary to support, we would heartily encourage them to get to know their missionary, build a relationship, and pray for them.

                We are Kevin and Ruth Horan, we founded Ergatas in 2020. Before Ergatas, we had served as 
                missionaries for about 15 years. We met while serving together in 2011 and were 
                married in 2012. We have two kids, Zoey and Zachary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kevin has his degree in Computer Science and enjoys programming. Ruth has worked with gospel audio 
                materials and doing database work. She is excellent at organizing things. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When we started of in missions, the thought of raising 100% of our support was quite daunting!
                But over the past many years, God has graciously provided for us every single day. 
                We wish a tool like Ergatas had existed back when we were getting started, to make things
                a little easier. We hope this tool will help others on their partnership development journey.
