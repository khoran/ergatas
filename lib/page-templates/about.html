                    <h2>The Purpose of Ergatas</h2>

                    <strong>Typically, missionaries have to go out and find their partners - 
                        Ergatas changes that, allowing anyone to find a missionary. </strong>

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        Missionaries who are raising funds can
                        <a href="/profile" data-bind="click: navigateFn('profile')">create a profile</a> on 
                        the site at no cost, describing their ministry, where they will be ministering, 
                        what job skills they will be applying, and lots more.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Christians (maybe you!) who are interested in supporting a missionary can discover 
                        a missionary that they might be called to support. Perhaps you might support a 
                        missionary working in the same industry as you. Maybe you have a heart for a particular 
                        country and want to partner with someone ministering there. With Ergatas, you can find 
                        missionaries from different organizations, all over the world!
                    </p>

                                        Missionaries serving in sensitive locations should be careful what information they provide in their Ergatas profile, as 
                                        all of it will be publicly visible. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One possible approach to using Ergatas in that situation is to provide a false name in the profile, leave out any photos, and leave
                                        the location field blank. Care must also be taken that the provided donation link does not go to a page that lists the missionaries 
                                        name. In order to ensure the donation makes it to the missionary, the organization receiving the donation must be aware of the 
                                        false name used, and direct donations for that false name to the true missionary.

                                    <p>
                                        We cannot make any guarantees of safety and the above approach is just a suggestion. Each missionary must use their own judgement as 
                                        to whether or not creating a profile on Ergatas would put them at risk.
                                    </p>

                                        Ergatas is different for a few reasons. The main difference is that we focus on individual missionaries. 
                                        Ergatas aims to help missionaries raise support, not help organizations fund their projects (funding projects
                                        is of course a worthy goal, just not our goal!). 
                                        Of course, the organization benefits by having a fully funded missionary. A second difference is that 
                                        we are focused only on Christian organizations.</p>

                                    <p>It is critical that users be able to have faith in the validity of the missionaries represented.
                                        This is accomplished in a few ways. First, the missionary must select their organization from 
                                        an approved list. These have been manually inspected to ensure that they are registered 501c(3) 
                                        organizations, that the given website truly belongs to the organization, and that they are compatible 
                                        with our statement of faith.</p>
                                    <p>If the missionaries organization is not listed, they may apply to have the organization considered for 
                                        inclusion.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Secondly, the donation link given in the profile must match the verified domain of the organizations 
                                        website. The fact that the organization has provided them with a donation link also gives you 
                                        confidence that the organization has vetted the missionary.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Finally, profiles can be flagged by users for review if anything looks suspicious.

                                    <p>It is very often the case that a missionaries partners come from people they have a prior relationship with, and that is a wonderful thing! We firmly believe that missionaries should continue to cultivate relationships with people during partnership development.

                                    <p>But there are also some people who are interested in supporting missionaries who fit certain criteria, even if they don't know the missionary personally. For example, a doctor might want to support a medically skilled missionary. 
                                        Or someone might want to support those ministering to the totally un-reached. Someone who has a heart for a particular country might want to support a missionary working in that country, etc.

                                    <p>These are the kinds of people that Ergatas will be most helpful to. Of course, once a user finds a missionary to support, we would heartily encourage them to get to know their missionary, build a relationship, and pray for them.

                                        At least once every 4 months, missionaries are required to either update their profile information or confirm that 
                                        it is still current.
                                        Any profiles not updated or confirmed within that time will be disabled until an update is made. 
                                        You can see the last date an update was made on the missionaries profile page.

                                        Over 180 organizations are already approved that can be selected by missionaries. If you don't see 
                                        your organization in the list though, you can apply to have it added.

                                        For an organization to be approved, it must meet the following requirements:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>

                                            Has an online donation page that allows donations to be designated to specific missionaries.

                                            A registered non-profit. In the USA, that means a 501c(3)

                                    Once you submit the application, we will review it and get back to you within a week. 
                                    If the organization is approved, then it will become available for anyone
                                    to select on their profile. Approval only needs to be done once per organization, not
                                    for each missionary in that organization.
                                    </p>

                        Kevin and Ruth Horan founded Ergatas in 2020. Before Ergatas, they had both served as 
                        missionaries for about 15 years. They met while serving together in 2011 and were 
                        married in 2012. Their two kids are Zoey and Zachary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kevin earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2011 and enjoys programming. Ruth has worked with gospel audio 
                        materials and doing database work. She is excellent at organizing things. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Kevin started off in missions, the thought of raising 100% of his support was quite daunting!
                        But over the past many years, God has graciously provided for them every single day. 
                        Kevin wished a tool like Ergatas had existed back when he was getting started, to make things
                        a little easier. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We hope this tool will help others on their partnership development journey.
                    </p>
