                            We just launched in December! We're still growing, so if your looking for missionaries,

                    <h2>The Purpose of Ergatas</h2>


                    <p>We want to be part of the solution to two major problems in the world today 
                        (yea, there are lots out there, but two is enough!).</p>

                    <p>The first is that it takes a long time for missionaries to raise support. 
                        It's a tough job recruiting missionaries in the first place, but then it often takes
                        1-2 years before they can get to work, if they make it at all. </p>

                    <p>The second problem is that many Christians are missing out on the blessings of being part of the Great Commission! </p>

                    <p>So what can be done? Incredibly, one solution can help with BOTH problems! 
                        (Hey, that's why you picked them right?!). <strong>We partner Christians with missionaries. 
                        The Christian is blessed, and the missionary gets to work sooner. </strong></p>

                    <p>Missionaries who are raising funds can create a profile on the site at no cost, describing their ministry, 
                        where they will be ministering, what job skills they will be applying, and lots more. 
                        Ergatas widens their network of potential partners to the world! </p>

                    <p>Christians (maybe you!) who are interested in missions can discover a missionary, 
                        from any organization, that they might be called to support. Perhaps a missionary 
                        working in the same industry. Maybe they have a heart for a particular country and want to partner 
                        with someone ministering there. </p>

                    <p>But not all partnerships are made in an instant! If you're not ready to commit yet, 
                        you can message the missionary anonymously to ask questions and get to know them. You can sign up for 
                        their newsletter, or pray for them. If/when you feel led, you can partner with them through financial support. </p>

                    <p>When you are ready to make a donation, we collect the funds and transfer them to the workers' sending organization,
                        designated for their support.  Ergatas does not take any portion of the donation.</p>

                                        When you make a donation to a worker, we collect the funds and transfer them to the workers sending organization, designated for

                                        Missionaries serving in sensitive locations should be careful what information they provide in their Ergatas profile, as 
                                        all of it will be publicly visible. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One approach to using Ergatas in that situation is to use an alias in the profile, leave out any photos, and leave
                                        the location field blank. Care must also be taken that the provided donation link does not go to a page that lists the missionaries 
                                        name. In order to ensure the donation makes it to the missionary, the organization receiving the donation must be aware of the 
                                        alias used, and direct donations for that alias to the true missionary. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Even if an alias is used and no location is given, you should consider
                                        what information your profile details may reveal about your location. For example,
                                        if you're working with a very small people group that only lives in one location,
                                        then specifying that people group would also reveal your location.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We cannot make any guarantees of safety. Each missionary must use their own judgement as 
                                        to whether or not creating a profile on Ergatas would put them at risk.

                                        Ergatas is different for a few reasons. The main difference is that we focus on individual missionaries. 
                                        Ergatas aims to help missionaries raise support, not help organizations fund their projects (funding projects
                                        is of course a worthy goal, just not our goal!). 
                                        Of course, the organization benefits by having a fully funded missionary. A second difference is that 
                                        we are focused only on Christian organizations.</p>

                                    <p>It is critical that users be able to have faith in the validity of the missionaries represented.
                                        This is accomplished in a few ways. First, the missionary must select their organization from 
                                        an approved list. These have been manually inspected to ensure that they are registered 501c(3) 
                                        organizations, that the given website truly belongs to the organization, and that they are compatible 
                                        with our statement of faith.</p>
                                    <p>If the missionaries organization is not listed, they may apply to have the organization considered for 
                                        inclusion.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Secondly, the donation link given in the profile must match the verified domain of the organizations 
                                        website. The fact that the organization has provided them with a donation link also gives you 
                                        confidence that the organization has vetted the missionary.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Finally, profiles can be flagged by users for review if anything looks suspicious.

                                    <p>It is very often the case that a missionaries partners come from people they have a prior relationship with, and that is a wonderful thing! We firmly believe that missionaries should continue to cultivate relationships with people during partnership development.

                                    <p>But there are also some people who are interested in supporting missionaries who fit certain criteria, even if they don't know the missionary personally. For example, a doctor might want to support a medically skilled missionary. 
                                        Or someone might want to support those ministering to the totally un-reached. Someone who has a heart for a particular country might want to support a missionary working in that country, etc.

                                    <p>These are the kinds of people that Ergatas will be most helpful to. Of course, once a user finds a missionary to support, we would heartily encourage them to get to know their missionary, build a relationship, and pray for them.

                                        At least once every 2 years, missionaries are required to either update their profile information or confirm that 
                                        it is still current.
                                        Updates are rewarded by causing the profile to show up higher in search results. 
                                        Any profiles not updated or confirmed within that time will be disabled until an update is made. 
                                        You can see the last date an update was made on the missionaries profile page.

                                        Yes! By "claiming" an organization and being approved, you can then create new profiles and edit existing profiles for
                                        your organization. This allows one person to manage profiles on behalf of workers who may not have easy internet access.

                                        A landing page is a collection of worker profiles that are associated with an organization in some way. This may
                                        be simply by employment, or something else. For example, a church may want to collect all the workers they partner 
                                        with, or a mobilization agency could collect workers from their partner agencies. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once a collection of workers is created, we provide a sharing link like "your-org.ergatas.org", along with a QR code. 
                                        This link leads to a simplified page that does not have the normal Ergatas menu, but just shows the worker profile cards
                                        and search interface.
                                        It can also be embedded into an existing webpage (using an iframe), so that it appears to be part of your own website.

                                    <p>
                                        Before a landing page can be created for an organization, a member representing that organization must "claim" it. This is done
                                        by filling in an application and going through a verification step.

                        Kevin and Ruth Horan founded Ergatas in 2020. Before Ergatas, they had both served as 
                        missionaries for about 15 years. They met while serving together in 2011 and were 
                        married in 2012. Their two kids are Zoey and Zachary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kevin earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2011 and enjoys programming. Ruth has worked with gospel audio 
                        materials and doing database work. She is excellent at organizing things. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Kevin started off in missions, the thought of raising 100% of his support was quite daunting!
                        But over the past many years, God has graciously provided for them every single day. 
                        Kevin wished a tool like Ergatas had existed back when he was getting started, to make things
                        a little easier. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We hope this tool will help others on their partnership development journey.
