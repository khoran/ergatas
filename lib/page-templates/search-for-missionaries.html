                        We offer the unique ability to search for missionaries across organizations
                        with specific criteria.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do you have a passion in your heart to help a specific people group? Or a particular 
                        country? Wouldn't it be great if you could find missionaries already making an
                        impact in those areas and come alongside them and their ministry? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Would you like to support a missionary that you feel a connection with? Perhaps through 
                        a shared job skill? Maybe you're a teacher and would love to support missionaries using
                        teaching to spread the Gospel. Or are you techie wanting to see more techies doing 
                        Kingdom work?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In all theses scenarios, Ergatas makes it possible to find missionaries who are already 
                        on their way to the mission field to accomplish the work that you care about.
