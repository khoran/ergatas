                    <p>
                        Do you have a passion in your heart to help a specific people group? Or a particular 
                        country? Wouldn't it be great if you could find missionaries already making an
                        impact in those areas and come alongside them and their ministry? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Would you like to support a missionary that you feel a connection with? Perhaps through 
                        a shared job skill? Maybe you're a teacher and would love to support missionaries using
                        teaching to spread the Gospel. Or are you techie wanting to see more techies doing 
                        Kingdom work?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In all theses scenarios, Ergatas makes it possible to find missionaries who are already 
                        on their way to the mission field to accomplish the work that you care about. For some, 
                        they can get started with their ministry as soon as they reach full funding. Others are 
                        already doing the work, but need to replace lost funding in order to stick with it. 
                    </p>
