                        - missionaries are not "super christians" with no fears or doubts
                        - real effects

                        - spiritual warfare
                        - find a list of missionaries to pray for on twitter
                        - allow notifications to be prompted to pray each day

                        How important is prayer really? Isn't it just a consolation prize offered by those who
                        don't want to give real money? Missionaries are super Christians! What could my little
                        prayers really accomplish?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Have any of these thoughts ever crossed your mind? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Missionaries are not "super christians"! Every Kingdom worker is just an ordinary person like
                        you and me. They have fears, doubts, and real struggles with sin in their life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to not being perfect (gasp!), they go to places where the Gospel is not. That means 
                        places where the enemy has a stronghold. Spiritual warfare is a reality for all Christians, but
                        Satan focuses his attacks on those who are doing the most damage to his earthly kingdom, which is 
                        generally those spreading the Gospel.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So, we have a non-super Christian incurring the special attention of the enemy. What do they need to 
                        endure that? Prayer! When Christ taught his disciples to pray, He said: 
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-5">
                        "And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one." Matt 6:13
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In Matt 26:41 we read:
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-5">
                        â€œWatch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In John 17:15 we find: 
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-5">

                        "My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even the Apostle Paul asks for prayer in Eph 6:19:
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-5">
                        "Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So prayer is not just a consolation prize!  Prayer is what pushes back the enemy and protects God's workers.
                        It is an absolutely vital part of any Kingdom workers ministry. 
                        A missionary simply cannot succeed without prayer! The truth is that your prayers can open doors that 
                        no amount of money ever could. Prayer can soften hearts, build relationships,
                        give missionaries the right words to say, and so much more. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But prayer isn't just helpful to the worker, it is a blessing to you as well! Spending time with God in 
                        prayer draws us closer to Him, where we can experience His peace and calmness.

                    <p>
                        Would you commit to just 5 minutes a day to pray for a missionary? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
