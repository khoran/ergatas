                    <p>
                        You might be familiar with Unreached People Groups (UPGs) or even Unenganged Unreached People groups (UUPGs). 
                        These are people groups with less than 5% Christians of any kind, and make up about 
                        <a href="https://joshuaproject.net/filter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42% of the worlds population</a>. 
                        For many of these people groups, a foothold has been established, with still more to be done. 
                        But there is another group within the UPGs for which no foothold has been established. These are the 
                        Frontier People Groups (FPGs).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://joshuaproject.net/frontier/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frontier people groups </a> 
                        are those groups who have virtually no access the Gospel. In each FPG, less 
                        than 0.1% are Christians of any kind. That means a person in one of those groups would have to encounter 1,000 people
                        before they came across 1 Christian! 
                        Without outside help, these people groups will never hear the Good News of Christ.

                    <p>
                        You might think that these groups must be a relatively small percentage of the world by now, but in fact, 
                        they make up <a href="https://joshuaproject.net/frontier/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25% of the global population</a>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even worse, only  <a href="http://www.thetravelingteam.org/stats#missionaries-and-workers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1% of all field missionaries</a> are making an effort to reach FPGs! This is a great imbalance.
                        An FPG laborer has to reach 32 people for every 1 person the other 99% have to reach.
                        Compounding the problem, FPGs are the hardest to reach. 
                        So, FPG missionaries 
                        have to reach 32 times more people, and each person might require 10 times the effort. So really, they are 
                        shouldering 320 times the work load. This is a great imbalance indeed!

                    <p>
                        So what can be done about this imbalance? We certainly we need more laborers to focus on UPGs and FPGs.
                        But there is another problem. Much effort is spent on recruiting laborers to go and reach
                        these people groups, a critical step. But once a worker chooses to go, 
                        they have a long road ahead of them to build a team of prayer and financial 
                        partners. This stage can sometimes take years to accomplish, and sometimes workers even despair and
                        give up before reaching the field. 
                        During this stage there are willing and eager laborers not able to fulfill their heavenly calling.
                    </p>

                        Here is where you come in! You can make a huge impact on getting more laborers to the FPGs by 
                        finding a worker already heading their way and partnering with them. Together, we can 
                        get these workers to the Frontier People Groups sooner than later!
                    </p>
