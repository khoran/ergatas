                  <p>
                     Did you know there are lots of highly effective ways 
                     to help the ministry of Ergatas without spending a dime?
                     And really, helping Ergatas is helping our workers!
                     Below are some ideas.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Social</h4>
                  <p>
                     Social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and others, are
                     a great way to spread the word. Simply sharing a workers
                     profile, or a post from our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ergatas">Facebook</a>
                     page is almost as 
                     effective as a paid advertisement, but costs nothing!
                     It's easy to think, "what could one share accomplish?". But
                     when many people share, the effects are great. 
                     You can share posts to your friends, or if you know of
                     any relevant groups, you can share to them also.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     It also helps to "follow" Ergatas on either <a
                        href="https://www.facebook.com/ergatas">Facebook</a>,
                     <a href="https://twitter.com/Ergatas">Twitter</a>, or
                     <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ergatas777/">Instagram</a>.
                     Reacting to posts is another great
                  way to increase the odds of that post being shown to more
                  people. Did you know that, while "liking" a post on Facebook
                  is good, using a different reaction, like "love", "care",
                  "wow", and others, actually caries more weight with Facebook? So use one of
                  those other reactions whenever possible. 
                  </p>

                  <h4>Online Links</h4>
                  <p>
                  Another great way to help is by spreading links to Ergatas
                  online. For example, writing a blog post, or adding a link
                  to us from a website you manage. When Google sees a lot of
                  other websites linking to Ergatas, it "learns" that Ergatas
                  must be an important website, and thus is more likely to
                  rank us higher in its search results. This can be just as
                  effective as paid advertising, but it doesn't cost anything!
                  </p>

                  <h4>Word of Mouth</h4>
                  <p>
                     Even with all this modern technology, simple word of
                  mouth is still extremely effective! 
                  Tell your church's missions committee, tell
                  any missionaries you know, just tell everyone! You never
                  know who may know a Kingdom worker who could benefit from
                  Ergatas, or in whom God may be preparing a heart of
                  generosity who just needs to know what peoples needs are.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Prayer</h4>
                  <p>
                  Last but certainly not least, is prayer. Apart from God we
                  can do nothing. We cannot do this on our own strength using our
                  own clever thinking or our own connections. It has to be God
                  doing the work, providing the right connections, and
                  everything else that goes into this work. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Here are some prayer points:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        Pray for donations to be made to workers on our site.
                     All this work is for nothing if it doesn't help our
                     workers.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <a href="/learn/pray-for-a-missionary"
                           data-bind="click:
                           navigateFn('/learn/pray-for-a-missionary')">Pray
                           for the ministries of the workers on Ergatas</a>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Pray for more workers to learn about Ergatas so that
                        they also may be able to benefit.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Pray that we would continually follow God's leading
                     in how we can best help those workers God has called to
                     build His Kingdom.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
