                    <p>Do we get rewards in heaven for the good things we do
                    here on earth? Does the idea of earning rewards in heaven
                    make you cringe with thoughts of the prosperity gospel, or
                    of being motivated by the wrong things?  </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        Does the idea of earning rewards in heaven make you cringe?
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Let's look both at what the Bible says, and why so many
                    have a negative reaction to this idea. </p>

                    <p>First, we cannot earn our entry into heaven. The Bible
                    makes this very clear. Eternity with God is His free gift
                    for all who believe. </p>



                    <p class="mx-5">"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that
                    not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of
                    works, so that no one may boast." Ephesians 2:8-9 </p>

                    <p>But the Bible does talk about being rewarded to varying
                    degrees once we are in heaven, based on the things we do
                    here on earth.  </p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> 
                                <p>"But lay up for yourselves <strong>treasures in
                                heaven</strong>, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and
                                where thieves do not break in or steal…" Matthew
                                6:20 </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>"But without faith it is impossible to please
                                Him, for he who comes to God must believe that
                                He is, and that He is a <strong>rewarder</strong> of those who
                                diligently seek Him." Hebrews 11:6 </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>"For the Son of Man is going to come in the
                                glory of His Father with His angels; and will
                                then <strong>recompense every man according to his deeds.</strong>"
                                Matthew 16:27 </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>"By faith Moses, when he became of age,
                                refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's
                                daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction
                                with the people of God than to enjoy the passing
                                pleasures of sin, esteeming the reproach of
                                Christ greater riches than the treasures in
                                Egypt; <strong>for he looked to the reward.</strong>" Hebrews
                                11:24-26 </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>"Blessed are you when men cast insults at
                                you, and persecute you, and say all kinds of
                                evil against you falsely, on account of Me.
                                Rejoice, and be glad, for your <strong>reward in heaven
                                is great,</strong> for so they persecuted the prophets
                                who were before you." Matthew 5:11-12 </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p> 


                    <p>Still, many of us have a gut reaction that if our actions
                    are motivated by rewards in heaven, then they are not truly
                    motivated by love. </p>

                    <p>To understand this reaction, consider a husband who buys
                    his wife some flowers. When she sees the flowers, she is
                    overjoyed! Anyone would say the husband was showing her
                    love. Now imagine the wife then opens her purse, pulls out
                    some cash and hands it to her husband as his reward, which
                    the husband was expecting.  </p>

                    <p>Suddenly it seems like the flowers were not
                    motivated by love anymore! But is this really the same thing
                    that is happening with our rewards in heaven? When we read 
                    of heavenly “rewards,” it is easy to equate them with money or something equivalent,
                    but that is a false picture. </p>

                    <p>Consider again the husband giving his wife flowers, this
                    time with no money involved. </p>

                    <p>Does he still receive some reward? Does he stoically hand
                    her the flowers with a straight face, making sure to take no
                    joy or pleasure in the event? Or does he smile and
                    experience joy at seeing his wife enjoy receiving the
                    flowers? Isn't that a reward for the husband? But we would
                    still say that his actions were loving. The husband's reward 
                    was rooted in the joy of the person he was blessing.
                    That is the kind of reward we should be working for.
                     </p>
                    

                    <p>
                        Another common stumbling block is when we consider rewards to come at the 
                        expense of others. For example, in a race, there is only one winner, and they get 
                        the reward, to the exclusion of others. But heavenly rewards are not like this, 
                        we can encourage everyone to work for the same rewards in heaven and we would all 
                        benefit from them together. 
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        It is possible to love while still receiving a reward.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>So we see that it is possible to love while still
                    receiving a reward, but perhaps not the kind of reward we
                    often think of. Remember, the bible talks about earning
                    rewards in heaven, not here on earth. That's why this is not
                    the false “prosperity gospel”, which (wrongly) “guarantees” earthly
                    material rewards for our actions. God may still choose to
                    bless us materially here on earth, but that is not
                    guaranteed. What is guaranteed though are His non-material
                    blessings now, and even greater rewards in heaven. </p>

                    <p>Being rewarded means receiving something we value. If we
                    value winning a race, then winning is our reward. If we
                    value money, then a cash prize is our reward, etc. </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        Jesus will be our greatest value in heaven.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>So, what will we value most in heaven? Will it be money?
                    Definitely not! Jesus will be our greatest value in heaven.
                    Our greatest delight will be knowing Him and experiencing
                    His glory.  </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>One thing I ask from the Lord, 

                                this <strong>only</strong> do I seek: 

                            that I may dwell in the house of the Lord 

                                all the days of my life, 

                            to <strong>gaze on the beauty of the Lord 

                                and to seek him in his temple.</strong>  

                            Psalm 17:4 </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>This is what the LORD says: “Let not the wise boast of
                            their wisdom or the strong boast of their strength or the
                            rich boast of their riches, but let the one who boasts boast
                            about this: <strong>that they have the understanding to know me,</strong>
                            that I am the LORD, who exercises kindness, justice and
                            righteousness on earth, for in these I delight,” declares
                            the LORD. 

                            Jeremiah 9:23-24 </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>I want to know Christ</strong>—yes, to know the power of his
                            resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming
                            like him in his death, …  

                            Philippians 3:10 </p>
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>Is it wrong to want to enjoy Christ more in heaven?
                    Certainly not! The more good deeds we do on earth, the more
                    of this kind of reward we will have in heaven. Jesus tells
                    us to store up our treasure in heaven (Matthew 19:21, Mark
                    10:21, Luke 12:33, Luke 18:22). </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        Too many of us are satisfied with just getting into
                        heaven when God wants so much more for us! 
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Too many of us are satisfied with just getting into
                    heaven when God wants so much more for us! Everyone in
                    heaven will be happy, but some will be happier, and
                    experience more joy than others, because of their rewards.
                    The ones with lesser rewards will not be jealous or
                    experience regret, but rather will be happy for those with
                    the greater rewards. They, in turn, will not look down on
                    those with lesser rewards, but will rather be full of
                    humility and thankfulness (1 Corinthians 12:26). <strong>But now is the time to decide
                    which of those two positions you wish to be in.</strong> </p>

                    <p>The Bible encourages us to think constantly about heaven: </p>

                    <p class="mx-5">“Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.” (Col. 3:2).  </p>

                    <p>How do we do this? Matthew 6:21 says: </p>
                    <p class="mx-5">“For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” </p>

                    <p>If we make heavenly rewards our treasure, our heart (and mind) go there naturally. </p>

                    <p>There are many ways to increase our rewards in heaven.
                    One simple and effective way is to pray for and support
                    another follower of Jesus in carrying the gospel to those
                    who are far from God. </p>

                    Kingdom Workers who are investing their lives in the same
                    concerns God has given you. Start with $10 or $25 a month
                    and see where God leads you from there. </p>
