                    The most common method of fundraising in recent years is the Self-Support model, in which missionaries
                    seek out churches and individuals to make monthly support commitments. When enough is committed for the missionary
                    to carry out their ministry, then they can begin. This has worked well in 
                    western cultures, but there are many others contexts in which it is not ideal. Tim Welch, author of 
                    <a href="https://missionbooks.org/collections/new-release-books/products/new-funding-models-for-global-mission" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                    "New Funding Models for Global Mission"</a> has outlined 17 other models that can also be used. We summarize them 
                    below and mention their main pro's and con's. Be sure to read the book for all the details.

                        For these methods funds primarily come from a business. But you can also
                        have an Ergatas profile on the side to bring in a little extra now and then.

                        <p><strong>Con:</strong> Time away from ministry; too often the self-employment fails.</p>

                        <p><strong>Con:</strong> Hard to make it profitable; requires a lot of capital to start</p>

                        <p><strong>Con:</strong> Creates dependency; can fall apart due to control issues.</p>

                        <p><strong>Con:</strong> Requires a large fund; requires much discipline to not use it for other needs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Nigeria, Ghana</p>
                    </div>

                        <p><strong>Con:</strong> It takes resources from the mission agency in the short term.</p>

                        <p>Twelve churches/groups take responsibility for one month of support per year.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pro:</strong> Reasonable responsibility for a church, less burden on the missionary</p>
                        <p><strong>Con:</strong> Reporting back to 12 churches every home assignment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Bolivia, Peru</p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Revolving Savings</h4>

                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Wide use in the majority world</p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Living Off the Fruit of Ministry</h4>
                    <div class="ml-4">
                        <p>The ministry, e.g. the planted church, starts to finance the missionary.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pro:</strong> Fits in with the culture/practices of the majority world.</p>
                        <p><strong>Con:</strong> Makes the missionary financially dependent on “the fruit”.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Côte d’Ivoire</p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Diminishing Support</h4>
                    <div class="ml-4">
                        <p>Similar to the previous model but with a plan for gradual decrease of outside support</p>
                        <p><strong>Pro:</strong> Clear and straightforward</p>
                        <p><strong>Con:</strong> As every situation is different, it needs to be applied in a variety of ways.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Nigeria</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="ml-4">
                        <p>Church members bring part of their harvest to church every week. It is sold, proceeds go for a mission or missionary.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pro:</strong> Works well with poor congregations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Con:</strong> Depends on local church to motivate and then do its part faithfully.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> North East India, Ethiopia</p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Mission Designation</h4>
                    <div class="ml-4">
                        <p>Church members designate a portion of their livestock or income to missions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pro:</strong> It allows relatively poor people to participate.</p>
                        <p><strong>Con:</strong> Depends on local church to motivate and then do its part faithfully.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Papua New Guinea</p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Focus on the Ministry</h4>
                    <div class="ml-4">
                        <p>The ministry, not the missionary, is adopted by the church. </p>
                        <p><strong>Pro:</strong> Helps when the missionary is unknown to the church but there is enthusiasm about a certain ministry.</p>
                        <p><strong>Con:</strong> Harder for long-term ministry</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Nigeria</p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Activities and Events</h4>
                    <div class="ml-4">
                        <p>Churches organize events to promote missions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pro:</strong> Increase of vision and giving; many people involved</p>
                        <p><strong>Con:</strong> Lots of short-term work</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Ethiopia, Côte d’Ivoire</p>
