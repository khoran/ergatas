                    <p>
                        When we first become a Christian, we put our faith in Jesus for salvation. 
                        But what happens to our faith after that? Does it just stay the same, 
                        or magically grow on its own, or something else?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Have you ever looked at a Christian who moved to jungles of Africa to become a missionary 
                        and thought, "wow, I could never do that, I don't have that kind of faith"? It would be 
                        like someone who's never done any running, looking at someone who's just run a marathon and 
                        thinking "I could never do that!". 
                    </p>
                       
                    <p>
                        So how does one go from not running at all to running a marathon? Practice! You start 
                        off running short distances, then gradually start running farther and farther until you can 
                        run a marathon. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The same principles apply to our faith. How does one go from being a new Christian to 
                        being able to take great steps of faith like moving to Africa? By takeing small steps 
                        of faith at first and building up to larger and larger steps. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With running it's easy to see what steps to take to improve, just start running! But what 
                        steps do we take to grow our faith?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before we answer that question, let's understand more about what faith is. Hebrews 11:1 says
                        "Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.". 
                        Faith is being sure that something will happen even when we can't see how it will happen.
                        For example, when you sit on chair, do you inspect it each time and perform some load tests first? Or 
                        do you just sit on it, having complete faith that it will hold you up? Your faith in chairs has 
                        grown since childhood by having hundreds of examples of chairs holding you up. So now you don't even 
                        think about it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, we grow our faith by experiencing examples of God's faithfulness.
                        We can start by choosing a promise from the Bible that says if we do X, 
                        then Y will happen, 
                        even though the result might not make any sense. Each time we do this, and find that Y 
                        really happens, despite our doubts, our faith in God grows. The next time it's easier for us to 
                        do X even when Y seems even more unbelievable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One if the easiest and least scary ways to grow our faith in God is through giving.
                        The Bible makes several promises to us about giving:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Psalm 112:5: Good will come to those who are generous and lend freely, who conduct their affairs with justice.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Proverbs 11:25: A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                2 Corinthians 9:6-8: 
                                Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will 
                                also reap generously. Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or 
                                under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all 
                                things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here we can see the pattern, if we give (X), then God will bless us (Y). Now it's important to clarify 
                        here that "bless" does not just mean money. God's blessings could include money, but they can also include 
                        things like restored relationships, greater joy, a closer walk with God, and much more. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Giving is a good place to start because you can give as little as you want at first, then see what God does.
                        As you see His faithfulness, you can start to give more and more, and see how much more God blesses you!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, giving is the one thing in the bible that God actually wants us to test Him on! In Malichi 3:10 it 
                        says:
                    </p>
                    <p class="ml-5">
                        Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. <strong>Test me in this</strong>,” says the LORD Almighty, 
                        “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room 
                        enough to store it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There is a great story about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Colgate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">William Colgate</a>
                        (as in the popular toothpaste). When he started Colgate in 1806, he 
                        committed to donate 10% of all the companies income. As the years passed and God blessed his work, he increased his 
                        giving to 20%, then 30%, then 40%, and finally 50% of all the companies income! All the while, God blessed his 
                        efforts. William simply could not out-give God, and neither can we. Today, over 100 years later, Colgate-Palmolive is still the 
                        <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/09/12/colgate-or-crest-can-you-guess-which-is-americas-f.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

                        We encourage you to start your giving wherever you feel led to do so. But if you're still not sure, consider finding a 
                        missionary on this website and give them a gift. You don't have to commit to monthly support right away. For the cynics out 
                        there (it's ok, our founder is naturally cynical too), don't worry, our motives are pure!
                        We don't make any money from your donations. We exist only to point people like to you Kingdom Workers in need. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We firmly believe that you'll be blessed through giving, the worker will be blessed and able to carry out their work, 
                        and we are blessed to be part of the process.
