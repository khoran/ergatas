                    <p>Many churches and mission agencies have a webpage where
                    they display their Kingdom Workers, sometimes with a picture
                    and short description. But this is not easy to set up, and
                    <strong>usually lacks valuable features</strong>, such as searchability and a
                    map display. Updates can also be time-consuming, resulting
                    in out-of-date information. Ergatas has created a free
                    service that addresses each of these issues, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>Any church, mobilization ministry, or missions agency can
                    create a landing page on Ergatas.org that will <strong>show their
                    Kingdom Workers with detailed profiles about each worker, a
                    map view, and the ability to search by several ministry
                    details.</strong> These profiles can either be managed by a single
                    person, or <strong>each worker can manage their own profile</strong>,
                    allowing them to keep their information current. The page
                    can then be shared with a customized URL, a QR code
                    (provided), or embedded into a website. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <strong>Churches</strong> can use this service to collect Kingdom Workers
                    they are either sending out, or partnering with, into one
                    location, even if they are serving through different
                    agencies. This page can be shared with the congregation by
                    displaying a QR code on the screen during a service, for
                    example, or embedded into the churchâ€™s website. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Mobilization ministries</strong> can collect all the Kingdom
                    Workers they have mobilized, even though they may be serving
                    at different agencies. This provides a single, cross-agency,
                    place to share these workers with others. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Mission agencies</strong> of all sizes can use this service to
                    showcase each of their Kingdom Workers on their own website
                    without having to do all the setup required to create and
                    maintain worker profiles directly on their site. They
                    immediately get a very featureful worker display page, where
                    each worker can easily update their own information,
                    ensuring that it is always correct and up to date. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Ergatas profiles come with many benefits. They can be
                    searched by 14 different ministry details. People groups and
                    languages being reached are linked with the Joshua Project
                    and are thus discoverable by those searching that site.
                    Users can send workers messages, to better get to know them
                    and understand their ministry. They can also indicate they
                    prayed for the worker, which is always encouraging.
