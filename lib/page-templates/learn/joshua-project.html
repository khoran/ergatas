                           rel="noopener">Joshua Project</a> is a well known
                        resource for learning about the spread of the Gospel 
                        in different people groups and countries. Over 6,500
                        people visit the site each day.

                        <strong>They now also include links to Ergatas workers
                        whenever a worker indicates that they are working with
                        a specific people group or country.</strong>
                        This allows Joshua Project users who
                        are interested in one of those people groups or
                        countries to connect with workers already
                        making an impact there.

                    <p>

                        If your ministry is reaching a specific people
                        group or country with the gospel, <strong>you can take
                        advantage of these links from Joshua Project by

                        on Ergatas.</strong> As you create
                        your profile, if you'd like to be linked 
                        by country, be sure to put in your location.
                        If you're reaching
                        one or more people groups, either directly or in a
                        supporting role, you can also select them in your profile.
                        Links are then created automatically. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you already have an Ergatas profile and you've
                        entered your location and/or people groups, you're already
                        linked! You don't need to do anything more.

                        Laborer" at the bottom of that page. Clicking that
                        would take them to Ergatas with a list of all workers
                        in that country.

                        bottom of the page, and then be able to see a list of
