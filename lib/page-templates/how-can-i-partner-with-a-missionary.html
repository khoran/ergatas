                        A missionary partner is anyone who helps a missionary in their ministry, in whatever way they can. 
                        Three of the most common ways are by regularly praying for the missionary, being an encouragement, 
                        and through financial support. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prayer support is a critical need for every missionary, 
                        for we do not fight against flesh and blood, but against spiritual forces of evil in high places (Ephesians 6:12).
                        Prayer is our best defense in this battle. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Encouragement is also very important for missionaries, who are often facing challenging situations,
                        lack of resources, or any number of discouraging things. Sometimes they are alone in their work
                        with no one else to talk to. Hearing a word of encouragement from a partner through an email or phone
                        call can be huge blessing!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, every ministry requires financial support to function. Missionaries need to pay rent, buy food,
                        etc.  There are certainly cases where working a normal job while doing ministry makes sense. But every hour
                        a missionary spends at work is an hour they cannot perform the ministry God has called
                        them to. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we partner with a missionary, we become 
                        <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/driving-convictions-behind-foreign-missions#conviction-13-mdash-our-aim-is-not-to-persuade-everyone-to-become-a-missionary-but-to-help-everyone-become-a-world-christian" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                        every much a part of their ministry as they are</a>.
                        Missionaries simply can't function without a team of partners supporting them. A missionary and
                        their partners are all one team, and they all share both in the burdens of ministry, but also in
                        the indescribable joy that comes from obeying God's word and fulfilling the great commission. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        God has called  some to full time ministry, and others God has called to support those in full time
                        ministry. Neither one is greater than the other. The missionary is not greater than a partner, nor
                        is a partner greater than a missionary. All of us serve together, as links in one chain.
                        Whether you are a partner, an at-home missionary working in an office, or on the field, each link  
                        is vital to accomplish the task that God has called all Christians to. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, if you choose to partner with a missionary, ask them how you can pray for them, send them messages
                        of encouragement, and commit to regular financial support.
