                        How do we do that? We work hard to connect you with people interested in 
                        supporting a ministry like yours. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our service is completely free.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        
                        First you create a profile, providing all
                        the details of you ministry, such as where you are located, what kind of 
                        job skills your using, areas of the world your work is making an impact, and
                        more. Then people can search through all our missionaries for someone matching 
                        their own criteria. Maybe they find you! They can read about your ministry. If 
                        they are interested, they can message you anonymously and get to know you more.  
                        When they are ready, they click your donate button and we send them
                        to your existing donation page. We don't take any part of the donation. 
                    </p>
