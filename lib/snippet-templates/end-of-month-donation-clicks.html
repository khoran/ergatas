     According to our records, someone on the Ergatas website clicked the
     donate button for your profile on the date(s) listed below. We don't have a
     dollar amount though. Would you mind confirming if a donation was
     actually made to you on the below date(s)?  
     </p>

     <p>
     Sometimes transactions post a day or two after the date they are made, so
     check 1-3 days after each date as well. 
     </p>

     <p>
     Date(s):
     </p>
     <div style="margin-left: 30px" id="dates"></div>

     <p>
     When a user clicks your donate button from Ergatas, they are simply sent to your donation page on your organization's website, so we lose track of what
     happens after that. Because we don't handle the donations ourselves (which saves you money!), we don't have any direct feedback on how effective we've been
     at helping people with their support. So, we would greatly appreciate your feedback!

     Thank you
